# Webpack by Example

This guide is to show you to quickly get setup with webpack using any framework. This is an ongoing project so any support or contributions are much appreciated. 

Webpack has many great features but most times I just want to get up and going with a simple Webpack config, not read through a bunch of guides/blogs on how to get started. Therefore, this repository is intended to be a guide to help you to quickly and painlessly get setup with Webpack in one convenient location.
